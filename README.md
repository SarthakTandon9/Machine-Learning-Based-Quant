# Machine Learning Based Quant Strategy
"Overview"
This strategy uses a Gradient Boosting Model to interpret multiple signals generated throughout trading, and determine if they're a win or a loss. I have also suggested a portfolio optimization script we can co-integrate with this, to optimize return over a larger period of time.
